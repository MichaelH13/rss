# RSS Reader Sample Project
If you don't have the overall requirements, you probably aren't an intended reviewer. Move right along :)

## Overview
Xcode version: 11.3.1
Swift lang version: 5.2
Does not use any 3rd party libs, but does include some self-rolled extensions that I've found to provide some nice syntactic sugar for better readability.

## Features
Supports dynamic type
Supports localization
Supports iOS 13 Dark Mode
Supports landscape

## TODO
Show a loading indicator while loading the albums/artwork.
Support core data caching for images (for negligable load times on a "poor" connection).
Support left-aligned layout for detail view.
Add spacer between bottom button and bottom of the scroll view or a gradient fade?

# Not handled
No Internet connection.
